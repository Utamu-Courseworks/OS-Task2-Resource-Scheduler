# CSC 2101 - OPERATING SYSTEMS | TASK 2

## Resource Scheduler Project

### Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a **Resource Scheduler** to optimize the allocation of employees (bank tellers or call center agents) to customer requests. The system aims to:
- Minimize customer wait times.
- Maximize resource utilization.
- Ensure fairness in task distribution.

---

## Project Tasks & Deliverables

### Activity 1: Project Setup
- Form teams of **2â€“3 students**.
- Create a **GitHub repository** for the project.
- All team members must contribute and collaborate through individual GitHub profiles.
- Set up a **GitHub Project Board** to manage tasks and milestones.

**Deliverable:** GitHub repository with initial setup and team members added.

---

### Activity 2: System Design & Implementation
The system simulates the arrival of customers in a bank, each with:
- **Randomized service time**.
- **Priority level** (VIP, Corporate, or Normal).

#### Features:
- **Dynamic Agent Assignment:**
  - Bank tellers or call center agents are assigned based on **availability** and **workload capacity**.
  - Each agent has a **workload limit** and an **availability status** (busy/free).
- **Scheduling Algorithms Implemented:**
  - **Round Robin Scheduling** â€“ Each agent receives tasks equally.
  - **Priority Scheduling** â€“ VIP and Corporate customers are served first.
  - **Shortest Job Next** â€“ Tasks with shorter service times are prioritized.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:**
  - Agent availability and workload status updates **every 5 seconds**.
  - Enables **bank managers** to make informed staffing decisions.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - **Average customer waiting time**.
  - **Agent utilization rate** (working vs. idle time).
  - **Fairness in task distribution**.

---

### Activity 3: Containerization & CI/CD Pipeline
#### Containerization with Docker
- **Write a Dockerfile** to containerize the application.
- Ensure the application can run in a **containerized environment**.

#### CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- **Set up GitHub Actions** for automating testing and deployment.
- Configure CI/CD pipeline to:
  - **Build and test** the application on every commit.
  - **Push Docker images** to Docker Hub.
  - **Deploy the application** to a cloud platform (GitHub Pages, AWS, etc.).

**Deliverable:** Deployed application URL.
